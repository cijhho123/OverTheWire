## What is Over The Wire?

OverTheWire offer a collection of wargames that are designed to help you learn and practice security concepts in addition to fostering and exercising a particular way of thinking. Thinking outside of the box is, inarguably, a hacker or coders most powerful ability. There are a million-and-one scripts and other tools out there and all of them are extremely easy to use in comparison to developing this ability. Even if you have the knowledge to write them yourself you will still need the requisite street-smarts to achieve the desired outcome. Developing this mindset will aid you in problem-solving for the rest of your life.
